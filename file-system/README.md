# File Systems

## Terminal Commands

### List Files

#### *nix (Mac/Linux) Shells

```bash
# List files in the current directory
ls
```

#### Windows Shells

```powershell
# Lists 
dir
```

### Change Directories

```bash
# Goes up a directory
cd ..
```

```bash
# Directories are relative to your current location
# Move into the directory named photos
cd photos
```

_Important_ In *nix based terminals (Mac/Linux), a forward slash `/` separates directories. Windows uses a backslash `\`.

### `mv` - Move files

## Practice

### From the GUI: Clean up your Downloads Folder

- Locate your Downloads folder
- Create a new Folder called `Older Files`
- Move any downloaded file that you no longer want into `Older Files`
- Delete files you no longer want

### From the Terminal: Remove that directory

- Change directories into `Downloads/Older Files`
- Remove a file using `rm`
