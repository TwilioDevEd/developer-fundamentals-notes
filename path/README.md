The path refers to a location on your [file system](../file-system/). Your system path contains an ordered list of places where your Operating System should look for the commands you type in your [terminal](../terminal/). You can see what your path is currently set to by examining it in your [shell](../shells). 

Various shells and operating systems allow you to modify this path which allows you to access commands from anywhere you may be in your file system.

## Set your path in your shell
